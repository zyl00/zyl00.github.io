<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third-year Ph.D. student from the School of Information and Communication Engineering of Dalian University of Technology, under the joint supervision of Associate Prof. [Xuanheng Li](https://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/2018011001/zh_CN/index.htm) and Prof. [Yi Sun](https://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/sunyi/zh_CN/index/774887/list/index.htm). My research interest includes mmWave radar based wireless sensing, signal processing and deep learning. Here is my [CV](images/my_fig.jpg).
